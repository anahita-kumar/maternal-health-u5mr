Population-weighted maternal health coverage analysis by U5MR status

# Health Service Coverage Analysis

This repository contains an end-to-end analysis of maternal health service coverage and its relationship to under-five mortality (U5MR) targets. The project was completed as part of an exam task and is fully reproducible.

## 📊 Project Overview

I examine population-weighted coverage of two maternal health indicators:
- **ANC4**: % of women with ≥4 antenatal care visits
- **SBA**: % of births attended by skilled personnel

Countries are grouped based on their progress toward U5MR targets as defined by UNICEF:
- **Achieved**
- **On Track**
- **Acceleration Needed**

## ⚙️ How to Reproduce

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open R (or RStudio) and set the working directory to the root of the project.
3. Run the two setup scripts in order:
   ```r
   source("user_profile.R")    # Installs and loads required packages
   source("run_project.R")     # Executes full analysis and generates report

4. The final output will be saved as:

    03_outputs/final_report.html
